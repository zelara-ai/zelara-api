- **Billing Integration**: Seamless integration with Stripe for payment processing and subscription management.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring using industry-standard tools.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent and informative error responses across all API endpoints.

## Architecture

For detailed architectural information, refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).
